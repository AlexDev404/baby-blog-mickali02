        <!-- Week 1 Content -->
         <h1>{{ .Header }}</h1>
        <p class="custom-font">In Week 1, we began by exploring the basics of Git, 
            covering installation, configuration, and essential commands for creating 
            repositories, committing changes, managing branches, and merging them. We 
            also delved into the client-server model, which illustrates how clients 
            request services from servers in web development. This model is vital for 
            scalability and ensures optimal performance by effectively handling increased 
            traffic. Additionally, we discussed JavaScript fundamentals, focusing on its 
            characteristics as a high-level, interpreted, and dynamically typed language. 
            We classified programs into I/O bound and compute bound, and examined JavaScript's 
            single-threaded execution model, along with its approach to asynchronous programming 
            through the call stack, event loop, and task queues.</p>
