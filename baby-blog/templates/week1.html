        <h1>Week 1</h1>
        <p>In Week 1, we covered the basics of Git, including installation, configuration, 
            and commands for creating repositories, committing changes, managing branches, 
            and merging them. We explored the client-server model, which explains how clients 
            request services from servers in web development. This model supports scalability 
            and ensures optimal performance by efficiently handling increased traffic. We also 
            discussed JavaScript fundamentals, focusing on its characteristics as a high-level, 
            interpreted, and dynamically typed language, as well as the classification of programs 
            into I/O bound and compute bound. Additionally, we examined JavaScript's single-threaded 
            execution model and its approach to asynchronous programming, utilizing the call stack, 
            event loop, and task queues.</p>
